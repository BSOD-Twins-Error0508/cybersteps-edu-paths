Welcome to your pre-class preparation. Before our live session, it's important to understand the fundamental concepts behind how we discover security weaknesses in systems and applications. This preparation will introduce you to vulnerabilities, how they are cataloged, and the automated tools we use to find them.

### What is a Vulnerability?

In cybersecurity, a **vulnerability** is a weakness or flaw in a system, application, or process that can be exploited by a threat actor to cause harm. Think of it like a weak lock on a door. While the door is meant to keep intruders out, the faulty lock provides a way for someone to bypass the security measure.

Vulnerabilities can exist for many reasons:

- **Programming Errors (Bugs):** Mistakes in the source code that create unintended security holes.
- **Misconfigurations:** Systems that are not set up securely. For example, leaving a server with its default password.
- **Outdated Software:** Software that hasn't been updated (or "patched") to fix known security issues.
- **Design Flaws:** Fundamental problems in how a system is designed that make it inherently insecure.

### A Universal Language: CVE

With so many different software vendors and security researchers discovering vulnerabilities, how does everyone keep track? The solution is the **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)** system.

A CVE is a unique identifier for a specific, publicly known cybersecurity vulnerability. Managed by the MITRE Corporation, the CVE system provides a standardized name for each flaw. This allows security professionals, IT teams, and software vendors to talk about the same issue using a common reference point.

A CVE identifier has a simple format: `CVE-YYYY-NNNNN...`, where:

- `CVE`: The standard prefix.
- `YYYY`: The year the vulnerability was reported.
- `NNNNN...`: A unique sequence of digits for that year.

For example, `CVE-2017-5638` was a critical vulnerability in the Apache Struts web framework that led to major data breaches, including the one at Equifax.

### Think about it

Why is having a standardized naming system like CVE so important for the cybersecurity industry? What problems would arise if it didn't exist?

### Measuring the Danger: CVSS

Not all vulnerabilities are created equal. Some are minor, while others can be catastrophic. To provide a standardized measure of severity, we use the **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)**.

CVSS provides a numerical score, typically from 0.0 (no severity) to 10.0 (critical), to rate the severity of a vulnerability. This score helps organizations prioritize which vulnerabilities to fix first. A high CVSS score (e.g., 9.0 or above) usually means the vulnerability is easy to exploit and can have a severe impact, requiring immediate attention.

The score is calculated based on a set of metrics, including:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** How the vulnerability can be exploited (e.g., over the network, with physical access).
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** How difficult it is to perform the exploit.
- **Impact Metrics:** How the vulnerability affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.

When you see a vulnerability report, it will almost always include a CVE identifier and a CVSS score.

### What is Vulnerability Scanning?

**Vulnerability scanning** is the automated process of proactively identifying security weaknesses in computer systems, networks, and applications. A vulnerability scanner is a software tool that scans a target and checks for known vulnerabilities.

The scanner works by:

1. Identifying the systems running on a network and the services (e.g., web servers, databases) they are operating.
2. Probing these services for known flaws, misconfigurations, and outdated software versions.
3. Comparing its findings against a database of known vulnerabilities (like the CVE list).
4. Generating a report that lists the discovered vulnerabilities, often ranked by severity (using their CVSS score).

### Types of Vulnerability Scans

Scans can be performed from different perspectives, which affects what they can "see."

### Unauthenticated vs. Authenticated Scans

- **Unauthenticated (or Uncredentialed) Scan:** This scan is performed from the perspective of an external attacker with no login credentials. It's great for seeing what an outsider can easily discover about your systems. It looks for issues like open ports, vulnerable services, and missing web security headers.
- **Authenticated (or Credentialed) Scan:** For this scan, the scanner is given user credentials (like a username and password) to log into the target system. This "insider" view is far more detailed. It can identify issues that are not visible from the outside, such as missing security patches, weak local passwords, and insecure software configurations. It's like letting a security inspector inside your house to check every room, instead of just having them look at it from the street.

### Think about it

You are a security analyst. When would you choose to run an unauthenticated scan? When would an authenticated scan be more appropriate?

### Common Vulnerability Scanners

There are many vulnerability scanning tools available, but two of the most well-known are:

- **Nessus:** Developed by Tenable, Nessus is one of the most popular and powerful vulnerability scanners in the world. It has a massive database of vulnerabilities and is widely used by cybersecurity professionals. A free version, **Nessus Essentials**, is available for educational and personal use.
- **OpenVAS:** A free and open-source alternative to Nessus. It's part of the Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) framework and is a powerful tool, though it can be more complex to set up and manage than Nessus.

In our upcoming lesson and exercises, we will focus on using Nessus Essentials.

### Setup

Before our live session, you must complete the following setup. This is mandatory to participate in the hands-on activities.

**Goal:** Install Nessus Essentials on your Mac and ensure your Kali Linux and Windows virtual machines are running.

**Instructions:**

1. **Download and Install Nessus Essentials:**
    - Register for a free **Nessus Essentials** activation code at [Tenable's website](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials). You will receive the code via email.
    - From the [Nessus downloads page](https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus), download the correct installer for your macOS version.
    - Run the installer and follow the on-screen prompts.
2. **Configure Nessus:**
    - After installation, your browser should open to the Nessus web interface at `https://localhost:8834/`. Accept the security warning for the self-signed certificate.
    - Follow the setup wizard. Select **Nessus Essentials**, provide your activation code when prompted, and create an administrator account.
    - The final step is downloading the plugins. This is the database of vulnerability checks and **can take a significant amount of time to complete.** Please allow this process to finish.

You are now ready for our live session!
