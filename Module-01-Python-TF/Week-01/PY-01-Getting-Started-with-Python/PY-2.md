Write a Python program that uses the `input()` function to ask the user for their name. The prompt message displayed to the user must be exactly "Enter your name: " (note the space at the end).

After the user enters their name and presses Enter, your program should print a greeting in the format "Hello, [Name]! Welcome to Python.", where [Name] is the name entered by the user.

```
save_name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {save_name}! Welcome to Python.")
```
