Write a Python program that calculates the value of `(6 * 7)`.
Your program should then print this result using the `print()` function. 
The output must be preceded by the text "The answer is: " and a space.

```
# answer = 6 * 7
# print("The answer is: ", answer)

answer = 6 * 7
print(f"The answer is: {answer}")
```
