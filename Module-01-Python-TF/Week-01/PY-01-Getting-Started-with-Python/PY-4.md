Write a Python program that prints the following three lines of text exactly as shown, using a single `print()` command:

```
Line 1: Python is fun.
Line 2: It is also powerful.
Line 3: Let's learn more!
```

_Hint: You'll need to figure out how to represent text that spans multiple lines within Python. Search online for "python print multiple lines" or "python multi-line string"._

```
print("Line 1: Python is fun.\n" + "Line 2: It is also powerful.\n" + "Line 3: Let's learn more!")
```
