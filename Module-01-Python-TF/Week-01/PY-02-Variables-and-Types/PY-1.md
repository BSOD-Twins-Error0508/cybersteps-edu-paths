  
Write a Python program that:

1. Prompts the user to enter the first number with: `"Enter first number: "`
2. Reads the first number.
3. Prompts the user to enter the second number with: `"Enter second number: "`
4. Reads the second number.
5. Ensures both inputs are treated as whole numbers for calculation.
6. Calculates their sum.
7. Prints the final sum.

```
first_num = int(input("Enter first number: "))

second_num = int(input("Enter second number: "))

calc = first_num + second_num

print(calc)
```
