# Certificate Snapshot

_Signed, Sealed, Delivered... Let's Verify._

### Goal

Investigate a website's SSL/TLS certificate, specifically one issued by Let's Encrypt, and understand how certain fields relate to its automated domain validation process.

### Instructions

1. Open your web browser.
2. Navigate to a website known to use Let's Encrypt, for example: `https://community.letsencrypt.org` or `https://www.eff.org` (EFF often uses Let's Encrypt).
3. View the site's SSL/TLS certificate details.
4. Find and record the following information:
    - a) The **Issuer** (Organization and Common Name). Does it clearly indicate Let's Encrypt?
    - b) The **Subject Alternative Name (SAN)** extension. List all DNS names you find there. Why do you think SANs are crucial for CAs like Let's Encrypt that might issue certificates for multiple hostnames or subdomains under a single certificate?
    - c) The **Validity Period**. How long is this certificate valid for? Research briefly (a quick web search) why Let's Encrypt certificates have this specific duration.
    - d) Look for an "Authority Information Access" (AIA) extension. What information does it typically contain, especially the "CA Issuers" part? How might this help a browser build the trust chain?

### Submission

Submit your findings and answers for points a, b, c, and d.

**Antwort:**  
  
a.

Common name (CN)  
R10  
Organisation (O)  
Let's Encrypt  
Organisational unit (OU)  
<Does not belong to the certificate>

b.

Not critical  
DNS name: *.eff.org  
DNS name: *.staging.eff.org

c.

27.06.25, 17:23:40 MESZ - 25.09.25, 17:23:39 MESZ

Let's Encrypt chooses 90 days to strike a good balance:

Security (less abuse possible), automation (no manual renewal required) and modern best practice

d.

AIA Extension = Where can I get the missing modules?

CA Issuers = Download link for the intermediate CA

OCSP = Link for status check
