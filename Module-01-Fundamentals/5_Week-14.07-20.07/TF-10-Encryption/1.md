# Key Keeper's Quest

_Unlock the secrets, if you hold the key!_

**Goal**

Practice basic symmetric encryption and decryption using an online tool to understand the role of the key.

**Instructions**

For this exercise, you will use an online AES encryption/decryption tool, use this one [https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/aes/decrypt/](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/aes/decrypt/)

**Part 1: Decryption**

1. You have received the following secret message (ciphertext):`U2FsdGVkX193x6F+4/t+0ZtIl3srxuyX+ndzXmawgTmxQ38R55VcUHkwHLXAjDax`
2. The passphrase to decrypt this message is: `SecretKey123456!`
3. Use the online AES decryption tool to decrypt the message.
4. What is the original plaintext message?

**Part 2: Encryption**

1. Now, you need to send your own secret message. The plaintext is: `Encryption is fun and useful!`
2. The passphrase you will use is: `MyCyberKey!1234`
3. Use the online AES encryption tool to encrypt the message.
4. What is the resulting ciphertext?

**Part 3: The Wrong Key**

1. Take the ciphertext you generated in Part 2.
2. Try to decrypt it, but this time use a slightly different key, for example: `MyCyberKey@1234`
3. What happens when you try to decrypt with the wrong key? Briefly describe the result.

**Submission**

Submit your answers to the following:

1. The decrypted plaintext message from Part 1.
2. The ciphertext you generated in Part 2.
3. Your observation from Part 3 when using the wrong key.
