# Hash Tag, You're It!

_Can you spot the difference? The hash knows!_

### **Goal**

Understand how hashing is used to verify file integrity by downloading a public file, verifying its hash against its official published hash, and then observing how modifications to a copy alter its hash.

### **Instructions**

You will use the `shasum` command in your macOS Terminal for this exercise (`shasum -a 256 <filename>`) or an equivalent command if you are on a different OS.

**Part 1: The Official File & Its Hash**

1. **Go to the VS Code Checksum Page:** Open [https://code.visualstudio.com/sha](https://code.visualstudio.com/sha).
2. **Pick a File:**
    - Find a **"stable" VS Code version for macOS** (e.g., for Apple Silicon, Intel, or Universal). These are usually `.zip` files.
    - **Record its exact filename** (e.g., `VSCode-darwin-universal.zip`).
    - **Record its official SHA-256 hash** shown on the page.
3. **Get Download Link:**
    - Go to the VS Code download page: [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
    - Find the download link for the _exact same file_ you chose. Right-click the download button/link and copy the link address. **Record this URL.**

**Part 2: Download & Verify**

1. **Open Terminal.**
    
2. **Create a Folder & Go Into It:**
    
    ```
    mkdir vscode_verify
    cd vscode_verify
    ```
    
3. **Download the File:** (Replace `<YOUR_DOWNLOAD_URL>` with the link you copied)
    
    ```
    curl -L -O <YOUR_DOWNLOAD_URL>
    ```
    
    _(This might take a moment as the file is large.)_
    
4. **Check Your Download's Hash:** (Replace `<your_downloaded_filename>` with the actual name of the file you downloaded)
    
    ```
    shasum -a 256 <your_downloaded_filename>
    ```
    
5. **Compare:** Does the hash you just calculated match the **official SHA-256 hash** you recorded?
    

**Part 3: Tamper with a Copy**

1. **Copy the File:** (Replace `<your_downloaded_filename>` with its actual name)
    
    ```
    cp <your_downloaded_filename> VSCode-tampered.zip
    ```
    
2. **Change the Copied File:** This command adds a tiny bit of text to the end of your copied file.
    
    ```
    echo "some_change" >> VSCode-tampered.zip
    ```
    
3. **Check the Tampered File's Hash:**
    
    ```
    shasum -a 256 VSCode-tampered.zip
    ```
    
4. **Compare Again:** How does this new hash compare to the official hash and the hash of your original download?
    

### **Submission**

Submit your answers:

1. The specific VS Code filename you chose to download and its official SHA-256 hash (as recorded from `code.visualstudio.com/sha`).
2. The SHA-256 hash you calculated for your downloaded VS Code file.
3. Did your calculated hash for the original download match the "Official SHA-256 Hash"? (Yes/No)
4. The SHA-256 hash you calculated for your _modified_ `VSCode-tampered.zip` file.
5. Briefly explain what this exercise demonstrates about the use of hash functions for file integrity and their sensitivity to changes.
