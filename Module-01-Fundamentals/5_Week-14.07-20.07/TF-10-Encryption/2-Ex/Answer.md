This exercise shows how important hash functions are for checking file integrity:

Hash functions create a unique digital fingerprint for a file.

Even a tiny change to the file (e.g. a single byte) completely changes the hash and makes it completely different.

This makes it possible to check whether a downloaded file is unchanged and original. If the hash does not match, the file may have been manipulated or corrupted.

This protects against manipulation, malware and unintentional errors during download.
