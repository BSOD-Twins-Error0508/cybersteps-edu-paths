# Echo Chamber

_Just repeats what it hears... spooky._

**Goal**

Write a basic server and client from scratch to create an "echo" service. The client should send a message, the server should receive it and send the _exact same message_ back to the client, and the client should receive and print the echoed message.

**Instructions**

1. **Create the Server Script (`echo_server.py`):**
    - Import the `socket` module.
    - Create a socket.
    - `bind` the socket to an address (e.g., `0.0.0.0`) and a port (e.g., 9999).
    - Put the socket into `listen`ing mode.
    - Print a message indicating the server is listening.
    - `accept` an incoming connection. This will give you a connection object and the client's address. Print who connected.
    - Use `recv()` on the connection object to receive data from the client. Store the received bytes.
    - Print the received message (after decoding).
    - **Add Echo Logic:** Immediately `sendall()` the _same received bytes_ back to the client over the same connection object.
    - `close()` the client connection.
    - `close()` the server's listening socket.
    - Include basic `try...except` error handling around the socket operations.
2. **Create the Client Script (`echo_client.py`):**
    - Import the `socket` module.
    - Create a socket.
    - Define the server's address (`127.0.0.1`) and the port your server is listening on.
    - `connect()` to the server's address and port. Print a confirmation message upon connection.
    - Define a message string to send (e.g., "Hello Echo!").
    - Encode the message to bytes and `sendall()` it to the server. Print the message you sent.
    - **Add Echo Logic:** Wait to `recv()` the response (the echoed message) from the server. Store the received bytes.
    - Decode the received bytes back into a string and print it, perhaps prefixed with "Server echoed: ".
    - `close()` the client socket.
    - Include basic `try...except` error handling.
3. **Test your scripts:** Run the `echo_server.py` first, then run `echo_client.py`. The client should print the message it originally sent, but received back from the server.

**Submission**

Submit your `echo_server.py` and `echo_client.py` files.
