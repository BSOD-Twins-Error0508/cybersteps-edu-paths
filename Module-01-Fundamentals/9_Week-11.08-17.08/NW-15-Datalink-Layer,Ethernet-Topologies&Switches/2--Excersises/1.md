**Goal**

To practice locating and documenting the key hardware specifications of your own MacBook using the System Information utility.

**Instructions**

1. Open the **System Information** application on your MacBook (You can find it in `Applications > Utilities`, or by searching with Spotlight, or holding the `Option` key while clicking the Apple menu  and selecting `System Information...`).
2. Navigate through the **Hardware** section on the left-hand side.
3. Find and record the following details about _your specific MacBook_:
    - **Processor/Chip:** What is the exact name of the chip or processor (e.g., Apple M1 Pro, Intel Core i7-xxxx)? How many cores does it have (Total Number of Cores)?
    - **Memory:** How much total Memory (RAM or Unified Memory) does your system have (e.g., 8 GB, 16 GB)?

    - **Model Identifier:** Find your Mac's Model Identifier (e.g., MacBookPro18,1, MacBookAir10,1). This is usually under `Hardware Overview`.
4. Take a single screenshot showing the **Hardware Overview** page within the System Information app. Make sure the Model Identifier, Chip, Memory, and Graphics information are visible in the screenshot.

**Submission**

Submit your recorded answers for the Processor/Chip (Name and Core Count), Memory, Graphics, Storage (Capacity and Type), and Model Identifier. Also, attach the screenshot of your Hardware Overview page.
