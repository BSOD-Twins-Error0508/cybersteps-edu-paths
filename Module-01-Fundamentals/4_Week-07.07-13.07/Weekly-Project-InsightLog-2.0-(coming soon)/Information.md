Open source is one of the best ways to learn real-world development skills, collaborate with others, and build meaningful software. For this project, you’ll actively improve a real Python project as a team. Your goal is to review, understand, and enhance the **InsightLog** repository, which includes bugs, `TODOs`, and feature requests designed to give you hands-on experience working together in Git.

### About the Project: InsightLog

**InsightLog** is a Python tool for log analysis. It’s designed to help extract and analyze useful information from raw log files, such as IP addresses, error messages, and suspicious patterns, or anything you can define with flexible search patterns. In cybersecurity and operations, log analysis is essential for finding attacks, troubleshooting problems, and understanding system behavior.

Your mission is to make **InsightLog** better: fix bugs, complete `TODOs`, add new features, and improve the overall design and usability.

### Step 1: Explore and Understand

- Fork the repository to one of your team member's GitHub accounts. This will be the central repository you will be working on.
- Add other team members to the forked repo as collaborators ([How do I do that?](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository))
- Clone it locally and run it to see what it does.
- Study the code structure and main modules.
- Review existing issues, `TODO` comments, and feature requests.

### Step 2: Plan Your Improvements

- Meet as a group to choose which bugs to fix and which features to add.
- Divide tasks clearly among team members.
- Agree on your workflow and timeline before you begin coding.

### Step 3: Collaborate with Git Best Practices

- Use feature branches for each fix or feature.
- Make small, clear, descriptive commits explaining _what_ and _why_.
- Review each other’s code before merging.
- Keep your forked repo tidy and well-organized.
- **Recommended Practices:**
    - One change per branch.
    - Frequent, small commits.
    - Clear, meaningful commit messages.
    - No direct commits to `main` without a pull request and review. ([How do I do that?](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request))
        - **Important** - Change the base repo of the pull request to your forked repository, not the original repository!

### Step 4: Finalize and Share

- Merge all completed work into your team’s `main` branch.
- Test your final version thoroughly.
- Update the `README.md` if necessary to reflect your changes.

💡 **Tip:** If you need to find realistic log samples, GitHub is a great place to search! For example, check out projects like [https://github.com/logpai/loghub/tree/master](https://github.com/logpai/loghub/tree/master)

### What to Submit

1. A link to your team’s final GitHub repository.
2. A PDF project summary report, that includes:
    - What you fixed or added.
    - How you structured your collaboration.
    - Challenges you faced and how you solved them.

### Final Notes

The primary goal of this project is to simulate a professional development environment. The emphasis is on the process: clear communication, effective teamwork, and applying Git best practices. The skills you practice here, such as code review, collaborative problem-solving, and improving an existing codebase, are fundamental in the software industry.
